      <p><h2>A web property is a point of presence</h2> (e.g. a website, social media account, blog, etc.) on the web that is an asset of an entity (e.g. an individual or corporation) used for the purpose of representing a brand, person or other identity.
      <u>The property can be considered a communication channel for the entity whose identity is associated with it.</u> Points of presence on the web which contain content about an entity may not be property that can be owned by that entity (e.g. restaurant review pages on sites such as Yelp).
      Web property is considered intangible property and is analogous to real property in that it has ownership which can be recorded and transferred though ascertaining ownership is not always a simple or easy matter to resolve.[1] The issue of ownership can be particularly challenging in relation to the employer-employee situation.
      [2][3] Two current legal cases are likely to set precedent in this area, ยง PhoneDog v. Kravitz and ยง Eagle v. Morgan.</p>
